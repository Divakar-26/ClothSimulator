# üßµ Cloth Simulator (Verlet Integration) - C++ / SDL / ImGui

A lightweight and interactive cloth simulation built using C++ with SDL2 and ImGui, powered by Verlet integration for realistic physics. Inspired by soft body physics, this project simulates a dynamic fabric that reacts to gravity, wind, and user interaction.

## Features

- üîó Verlet-based point mass system
- üß∂ Realistic cloth behavior (tearing, pinning, swinging)
- üñ±Ô∏è Mouse interaction: tear, and pin nodes
  - MIDDLE MOUSE BUTTON -> pin
  - LEFT -> place a node
  - RIGHT -> to connect two nodes and remove connection
- üñ•Ô∏è UI controls via ImGui for:
  - Gravity toggle
  - Iteration count
  - Reset / pause simulation
